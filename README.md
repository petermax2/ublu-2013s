# ublu-2013s #
a minimalistic compiler for a simple programming language

## Motivation ##

This project started in a course about compilers at Vienna University of Technology.

## Dependencies ##

The following toolchain was used to create the compiler's support files:

- Lex
- Yacc
- Ox
- Iburg
- BFE

Some of these tools are old and may be orphaned by now.

## About the Content ##

The whole course was split into 8 excercises, therefore there are 8 directories containing the excercise as it has been handed in.

1. assembler coding task
2. assembler coding task
3. implementing the scanner
4. implementing the parser
5. implementing the attributed grammar
6. simple code generation
7. advanced code generation
8. complete compiler

## Compiling the Project ##

Every directory contains a Makefile.
